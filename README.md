I'd be glad to explain the provided C++ code for matrix multiplication using CUDA:

**Code Breakdown:**

**1. Header Inclusion and Namespace:**
   - `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input/output library for console input and output.
   - `using namespace std;`: Brings the `std` namespace into scope, allowing you to use objects like `cout` and `cin` without the `std::` prefix.

**2. Global Kernel Function (`multiply`):**
   - `global void multiply(int* A, int* B, int* C, int size)`: Declares a global kernel function named `multiply` that takes four arguments:
     - `A`: Pointer to the first input matrix on the device (GPU) memory.
     - `B`: Pointer to the second input matrix on the device memory.
     - `C`: Pointer to the output matrix where the result will be stored on the device memory.
     - `size`: Size (number of rows/columns) of the square matrices.
   - `int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;`: Calculates the global row index for the current thread using block and thread indices.
   - `int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;`: Calculates the global column index for the current thread.
   - `if (row < size && col < size)`: Checks if the calculated indices are within the matrix boundaries to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.
   - `int sum = 0;`: Initializes a variable `sum` to store the dot product result for the corresponding element in the output matrix.
   - `for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)`: Nested loop that iterates over each element in a row of the first matrix (A) that contributes to the element at `(row, col)` in the result matrix.
     - `sum += A[row * size + i] * B[i * size + col];`: Performs the dot product calculation, adding the product of corresponding elements from A and B to the `sum`.
   - `C[row * size + col] = sum;`: Stores the final dot product result (`sum`) in the appropriate element of the output matrix (C).

**3. Helper Functions:**
   - `void initialize(int* matrix, int size)`: Initializes the elements of a matrix with random values between 0 and 9 (exclusive).
   - `void print(int* matrix, int size)`: Prints the contents of a matrix in a formatted way.

**4. Main Function:**
   - `int main()`: The main function where program execution begins.
   - `int* A, *B, *C;`: Declares three integer pointers to allocate memory for the matrices on the host (CPU).
   - `int N = 2;`: Sets the size of the matrices (2x2 in this example).
   - `int blockSize = 16;`: Sets the block size for the kernel execution (can be adjusted based on hardware and problem size).
   - `int matrixSize = N * N;`: Calculates the total number of elements in a matrix.
   - `size_t matrixBytes = matrixSize * sizeof(int);`: Calculates the number of bytes required to store the matrix on the device memory.
   - Memory allocation on the host:
     - `A = new int[matrixSize];`: Allocates memory for the first matrix (A) on the host.
     - `B = new int[matrixSize];`: Allocates memory for the second matrix (B) on the host.
     - `C = new int[matrixSize];`: Allocates memory for the output matrix (C) on the host.
   - Initialize matrices A and B using the `initialize` function.
   - Print matrices A and B.
   - Memory allocation on the device (GPU):
     - `cudaMalloc(&X, matrixBytes);`: Allocates memory for a temporary matrix (X) on the device to hold a copy of matrix A.
     - `cudaMalloc(&Y, matrixBytes);`: Allocates memory for a temporary matrix (Y) on the device to hold a copy of matrix B.
     - `cudaMalloc(&Z, matrixBytes);`: Allocates memory for the output matrix (Z) on the device to store the result.
   - Copy data from host to device:
     - `cudaMemcpy(X, A, matrixBytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);`: Copies the contents of matrix A from the host to the temporary matrix X on the device.
     - `cudaMemcpy(Y, B, matrixBytes, cuda
